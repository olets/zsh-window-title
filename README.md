## Requirements

- Zsh

## Installation

### Homebrew

```shell
brew install olets/tap/zsh-window-title
```

### With a shell plugin manager

1. Install zsh-window-title with a zsh plugin manager. Each has their own way of doing things. See your package manager's documentation or the [zsh plugin manager plugin installation procedures gist](https://gist.github.com/olets/06009589d7887617e061481e22cf5a4a).

    After adding the plugin to the manager, restart zsh:

    ```shell
    exec zsh
    ```

### Manual

1. Download [the latest `zsh-window-title` binary](https://github.com/olets/zsh-window-title/releases/latest)
1. Either
    - Put the file `zsh-window-title` in a directory in your `PATH` and add `source zsh-window-title` to your `~/.zshrc` file
    - Add `source the/path/to/zsh-window-title` to your `~/.zshrc` file
1. Restart zsh:
    ```shell
    exec zsh
    ```

## Usage

Once zsh-window-title is installed, your terminal window title will be

- `<parent dir>/<current dir>` when nothing's running
- `<parent dir>/<current dir> - <first word of last run command>` when something's running
- `<parent dir>/<current dir> - <first two words of last run command>` when something's running and the first word of the last run command is one of the configured prefixes.

For example, after running `sleep 2` in the directory `~/olets/zsh-window-title`, the window title will be `olets/zsh-window-title - sleep`. After running `sudo sleep 2`, it will be `olets/zsh-window-title - sudo sleep`.

Note that the command is not parsed. If you run `echo hello world && sleep 10`, the window title will show `echo` for the duration, not `echo` for a moment and then `sleep`.

The number of path segments to show is configurable, and so are the prefixes. See [Options](#options).

### macOS Terminal.app users

By default macOS's Terminal app will control the window title. Disable that by:

> Preferences > Profiles > Window > Title --> uncheck everything.

### Oh-My-Zsh users

By default OMZ will control the terminal window title. Disable that by adding

```shell
DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE=”true”
```

to your `~/.zshrc` file.

### CLI

```shell
zwt restore-defaults
    (help | --help | -h)
    (version | --version | -v)
```

- `zwt restore-defaults` Restore options to their defaults in the current session. See [Options](#options).
- `zwt (help | --help | -h)` Show the manpage.
- `zwt (version | --version | -v)` Print the command name and version.

## Options

Variable | Type | Default | Use
---|---|---|---
ZSH_WINDOW_TITLE_COMMAND_PREFIXES | array | `( sudo )` | If the command starts with one of these terms, show it and the following word. (With the default, running `sudo sleep 10` will add `sudo sleep` to the window title.)
ZSH_WINDOW_TITLE_DEBUG | integer | `0` | If non-zero, print hook debugging messages
ZSH_WINDOW_TITLE_DIRECTORY_DEPTH | integer | `2` | How many directory levels to display
ZWT_DEBUG | integer | `0` | If non-zero, print CLI debugging messages
